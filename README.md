# Probabilistic-Naive-Bayes-on-Skytrax-Reviews
This project builds a full-on Probabilistic Naïve Bayes Sentiment Classification System for real-world airline industry reviews taken from Skytrax. We work with four datasets — Airline, Airport, Lounge, and Seat — each containing numeric ratings, text reviews, and categorical info from thousands of passengers.
